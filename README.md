# VizTwo

VizTwo is a repository of interactive visualizations for common algorithmic patterns based off the incredible [Grokking the Coding Interview](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-coding-interview) course.

It's built with Next.js for dead-simple routing and SSG, Framer Motion for animations and a [custom babel plugin](./lib/transform.js) for easy algorithm authoring.
